Adult but truly amazing
Married couple at a Zoo walks past a gorilla enclosure.
Says the woman: 'Mark, Do you know that gorillas are the only animals which resemble men in their behavior?
Look, seeing that no one is looking, I'll expose one of my breasts 2 it & see how horny it gets just as men do.'
Mary then exposes one of her breasts, and, sure enough the gorilla gets excited and grabs the bars of the enclosure as if it wanted to break free.
'See,' says the woman, 'Now, I know why you react the way you do; men can't control their animal instincts just like gorillas can't.'
Says Mark: 'Now expose both breasts and let us see what happens.'
The woman exposes both breasts to the gorilla and it gets very excited and is now desperately trying to escape from the enclosure.
Says Mark: 'This is incredible, now, pull your skirt up, turn around and expose your bum and let us see what happens!'
The woman pulls her skirt up, turns around with her bum to the gorilla, which by now ,was extremely aroused, breaks free from the enclosure, grabs the woman and starts yanking the clothes off her.
The woman yells: 'Mark , what do I do now? Please, help me!'
Mark replies: 'Now, tell him you have a headache and you're not in mood ... Let us see if Gorillas and Men are the same..

Johnny's father says, "We have an $80,000 mortgage on the house, and I just got laid off! There won't be a $200 bike this year."
Two days later, Little Johnny walks out of the house with all his belongings in a suitcase. His father asks him why he's leaving.

Actions speak for themselves
A young man, out on the tiles with his mates, spies the girl of his Dreams across a dance floor. Having admired her from afar, he finally gets up the courage to talk to her. Everything goes better than expected and she agrees to accompany him on a date the following Saturday evening.
Saturday night, the young man arrives at her house with a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates. To his surprise, she answers the door in nothing but a towel. 'I'm sorry' she exclaims, 'I'm running a bit late. Please come in and I'll introduce you to my parents who will entertain you while I finish dressing. I should warn you though, they are both deaf mutes." With this, she ushers him into the living room, introduces him to her parents and 
promptly disappears.
As you can imagine, this is a little uncomfortable as both of the parents are completely silent. Dad is sitting in his armchair watching football on TV and Mum is busy knitting.
After about 10 minutes of complete silence, Mum jumps from her chair, pulls up her skirt, pulls down her knickers and pours a glass of water over her backside. Just as sudden, Dad launches himself across the room, bends her over the couch and takes her from behind. He then sits back in his chair and balances a match stick in front of his eye.
The room is plunged back into eerie silence and the young man is shocked into disbelief. After a further ten minutes, the daughter returns fully dressed and ready for the evening. The date is a complete disaster. The young man is totally pre-occupied by the antics of the young lady's Parents.
At the end of the date, sensing something is seriously wrong, the young lady asks the young guy, "What's the matter? What have I done wrong?"
*'No, it's not you", he replied, "It's just that the strangest thing happened whilst I was waiting for you and I'm still shocked. Well, first your Mother jumps from her chair, lifts up her skirt, pulls down her panties and throws a glass of water over her behind. Then, as if that wasn't enough, your father races from his chair, leans her over the couch and does her from behind. He then sits back and places a match stick by his eye".
'Oh, is that all?' replies the girl.*
*
*
The man can't believe her casual response.
'Mum was simply saying 'Are you going to get this asshole a drink?' And Dad was replying 'No f *ck him, I'm watching the match'

War
After the end of the war, a young female reporter from a local newspaper was sent to write an article about the soldiers homecoming. She had interviewed half a dozen, when she met Jacky on the street.
"Excuse me," she said "but were you in the war?"
"Yeah, I was in the infantry."
"Would you mind to answer a few questions for a newspaper article?"
"No, I wouldn't mind at all."
"When you came home, when the war was over, what was the first thing you did?"
"I fucked my wife," Jack said bluntly.
The journalist went crimson, and tried desperately to change the subject.
"After that. I mean, what did you do after that?"
"I fucked her again," Jack answered.
The journalist turned even more red, and got even more desperate to change the subject."Other than that! Ummmm... what did you do when you were finished with all that?!"
"Then I unstrapped my shoes and my heavy backpack and fucked my sweetheart again."
